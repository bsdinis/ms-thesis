    \caption{Protocol for the fast intermixing of the distributed
    register and \ac{SMR} protocols in \ac{TEEMS}. By overlapping
    (and piggybacking) the optimized read to the state machine to
    get the policy and the reading of the current timestamp of
    the register (which is the first step of the write protocol),
    we can run both operations in parallel, since writing the
    value to the register only happens after the policy is
    verified. Note that the read operation can be similarly
    piggybacked (the value is only returned after the policy
    check)}\label{fig:teems_fast_mixing}
